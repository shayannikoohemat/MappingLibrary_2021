Action description:
Mapping library is moved from svn repository into Git repository, as follows:
- source files included
- binary files excluded
- gitignore designed to keep binary files excluded
- 3rd party libraries excluded (Foreign/)
- excluded Tools/miscellaneous/transform_two_PC_based_on_moments

Details on the separation are in move_binaries.txt

Excluded binaries and 3rd party libraries are available from a zip package
that is at ...

Cloning the git repository and unzipping the binary package gives the full 
functionalities of the mapping library (as from the svn).
