/****************************************************************
* 
*  Routine Name: lintor - This program determines the parameters of the Helmert transformation between the pixel coordinate system and the camera system using the coordinates of the fiducial marks in both systems.
* 
*       Purpose: This program determines the parameters of the Helmert transformation between
the pixel coordinate system and the camera system using the coordinates of
the fiducial marks in both systems.
-short_lib_description_end

-man1_long_description
This program determines the parameters of the Helmert transformation between
the pixel coordinate system of a digital image and the camera coordinate system of the scanned photograph. A least squares adjustment is performed using the
coordinates of the fiducial marks in both coordinate systems.

The relation between the pixel coordinate system and the photo coordinate system
is given by:

      ( x )              ( s_c   0  )   (  c - c0  )
      (   )  =  R_alpha  (          )   (          )
      ( y )              (  0   s_r )   (  r0 - r  )

with photo coordinates (x,y), pixel coordinates (r,c), rotation matrix
(R_alpha), pixel spacings (s_r, s_c), and origin of the photo coordinate system
in the pixel coordinate ksystem (r0, c0).

The parameters of the interior orientation of the camera with respect to the
photo coordinate ksystem (as they can be obtained from the camera calibration
protocol) have to be specified by the user. This information is used to
calculate the interior orientation parameters of the digitized image.
*         Input: .IP "imgpts" 15
structure containing the pixel coordinates of the fiducial marks.
.IP "photopts" 15
structure containing the photo coordinates of the fiducial marks.
.IP "interior" 15
structure containing the interior orientation parameters as provided by the
user.
.IP "xpp" 15
float x-coordinate of principal point in photo coordinate system.
.IP "ypp" 15
float y-coordinate of principal point in photo coordinate system.
*        Output: .IP "interior" 15
structure containing the interior orientation parameters as provided by the
user, updated with the principal point in the pixel coordinate system,
the pixel spacings and the rotation of the scanned photograph.
*       Returns: TRUE (1) on success, FALSE (0) on failure
*  Restrictions: The rotation between the pixel and photo coordinate system should be around
0 degrees.
