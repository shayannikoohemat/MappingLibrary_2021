/****************************************************************
* 
*  Routine Name: lpix2obj2d - This function transforms image coordinates to planimetric object coordinates given the grid parameters defining the relation between the two coordinate systems.
* 
*       Purpose: This function transforms a set of image coordinates to planimetric object
coordinates.
The relation between the 2D object coordinate ksystem (often used in orthophotos
or rectified imagery) and the image coordinate system is specified by the
object coordinates of the left upper corner of the left upper image pixel and
the pixel size. These three parameters are obtained from the grid definition
structure.
*         Input: .IP "grid" 15
structure containing specification of the 2D object coordinate system
.IP "imgpt" 15
structure containing the pixel coordinates of a point with their variances
*        Output: .IP "objpt2d" 15
structure containing the 2D object coordinates of a point with their variances
*       Returns: TRUE (1) on success, FALSE (0) on failure
*  Restrictions:
