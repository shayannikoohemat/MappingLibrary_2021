/****************************************************************
* 
*  Routine Name: lobj2pix - This function transforms object coordinates to image coordinates given the grid parameters defining the relation between the two coordinate systems.
* 
*       Purpose: This function transforms a set of object coordinates to image 
coordinates.
The relation between the object coordinate system
and the image coordinate system is specified by the
object coordinates of the left upper corner of the left upper image pixel and
the pixel size. These three parameters are obtained from the grid definition
structure. The height of the object points is discarded.
*         Input: .IP "grid" 15
structure containing specification of the 2D object coordinate system
.IP "objpt" 15
structure containing the 2D object coordinates of a point with their variances
*        Output: .IP "imgpt" 15
structure containing the pixel coordinates of a point with their variances
*       Returns: TRUE (1) on success, FALSE (0) on failure
*  Restrictions:
