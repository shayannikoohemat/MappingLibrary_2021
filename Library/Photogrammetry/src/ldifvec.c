/****************************************************************
* 
*  Routine Name: ldifvec - Derivation of difference vectors between two sets of image points.
* 
*       Purpose: Derivation of difference vectors between two sets of image points.
Difference vectors are computed for points with identical point numbers.
The vector is pointing from the reference data to the (measured) data
to be evaluated. The scale of this vector can be controled by an
exaggeration factor.
*         Input: .IP "imgpts1" 15
structure containing the image points of the reference set
.IP "imgpts2" 15
structure containing the image points of the (measured) set to be
evaluated
.IP "vs" 15
double scale factor for difference vectors
*        Output: .IP "vecs" 15
ImgLines structure containing the derived difference vectors
*       Returns: TRUE (1) on success, FALSE (0) on failure
*  Restrictions: 
*    Written By: George Vosselman
*          Date: Jul 26, 1999
