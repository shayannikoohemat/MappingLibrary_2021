* 
*  Routine Name: lpix2obj - This function transforms image coordinates to planimetric object coordinates given the grid parameters defining the relation between the two coordinate systems.
* 
*       Purpose: Library Routine for pix2obj
*         Input: .IP "grid" 15
structure containing specification of the 2D object coordinate system
.IP "imgpt" 15
structure containing the pixel coordinates of a point with their variances
.IP "height" 15
double value with the height of the object points
*        Output: .IP "objpt" 15
structure containing the object coordinates of a point with their variances
*       Returns: TRUE (1) on success, FALSE (0) on failure
*  Restrictions:
