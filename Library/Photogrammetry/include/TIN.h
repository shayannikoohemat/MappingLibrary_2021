        by specified closed polygons of the triangulation and by holes. In case
        of a constrained triangulations, points outside the specified polygons
        will result in an invalid triangulation. The polygons are specified by
        index pairs of the points of the polygon edges. When using holes, the
        edges of the holes need to be part of the list of polygon edges. In
        addition, a position inside each hole needs to be specified. Note that
        polygons and holes are optional. Calling this function with only the
        first two arguments will result in an unconstrained triangulation.

                          polygons that surround the TIN and edges of holes in
                          the TIN. The index of the first point is 0. The edges

                          specified as 0 1 1 2 2 0, i.e. three edges with the
                          indices of the end nodes. In this case, num_edges
                          should be set to 3.
