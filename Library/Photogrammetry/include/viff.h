/*
 *	Khoros Visualization/Image File Format (Khoros 1.0)
 *
 *	A Khoros data file is organized as a 1Kbyte header     
 *	followed by additional information.  The first two       
 *	bytes of the header tell what kind of stuff the          
 *	additional information is.  For Khoros image files,     
 *	the additional information consists of the maps,   
 *	the location data, and then the image or vector data.    
 * 
 *	The header fields where carefully selected to            
 *	prevent contradictions between categories, i.e. they     
 *	were chosen to be orthogonal to each other.  However,
 *	in several situations this causes the fields to supply
 *	redundant information.
 *
 *	Note that the structure contains pointers to the various 
 *	chunks of data.  These will make sense ONLY when the 
 *	data is in memory.  
 *
 *	*imagedata - points to a sequence of images, an image is
 *	made up of bands, and the bands are in a sequence; or
 *	it can point to vectors, where the vector dimension is
 *	the number of bands.
 *
 *	*maps - points to a sequence of 2-dimensional maps, a map 
 *	is organized as stacked columns.  A data value indexes map rows.
 *
 *	*location - points to bands of coordinate values, ie if
 *	two dimensional locations, then there would be a band
 *	of x's followed by a band of y's.
 *
 *	The Khoros convention for the image orientarion is	 
 *	with the image origin in the upper left hand corner.
