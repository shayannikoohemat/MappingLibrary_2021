        used, since their XY coordinates may be very different from other points
        and cause the "detection" of a scan line end. Therefore, only points
        below a certain height (max_terrain_height) are used.
        An end point is detected by checking the distances of points to the
        first point of a scan line. First, this distance will increase. After
        the end of the scan line this distance will become smaller. If the
        distance between the current point and the point most distance from the
        first point is larger than a multiple of the median distance between
        consecutive points, the latter point is considered to be the end of the
        scan line.
        If the approximate flight height is specified, a second algorithm will
        be applied. The results of the first algorithm are used to construct
        the approximate flight path (as a straight line). Using this line
        a second analysis to detect the scan line ends is performed. This
        analysis does not use distances in the terrain, but direction vectors
        from the scanner to the terrain points. In this way, height differences
        do not influence the scan line end detection. However, the flight path
        should be close to a straight line for this algorithm to work correctly.
        @param lines The derived scan lines
        @param median_dist Median distance between two consecutive points. Use
                           MedianInterPointDistance to compute this.
