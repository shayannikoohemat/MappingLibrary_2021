/** Approximate cylinder using plane fitting on Gaussian sphere.
	The steps of algorithm are as follows:
	-Estimate normals using kNN
	-Fit plane to normals plotted in 3D (Find normal direction of great circle on gaussian sphere)
	-normal of plane approximates cylinder axis.
	-point closest to origin is approximated by laser point mean
	-radius is given a constant value (its linear if other six parameter are approximately right)
